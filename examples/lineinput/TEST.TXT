The Amstrad CPC (short for "Colour Personal Computer") is a
series of 8-bit home computers produced by Amstrad between
1984 and 1990. It was designed to compete in the mid-1980s
home computer market dominated by the Commodore 64 and the
ZX Spectrum; it successfully established itself primarily
in the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and the German-speaking
parts of Europe, and also Canada.

The series spawned a total of six distinct models: The CPC 464,
CPC 664, and CPC 6128 were highly successful competitors in the
European home computer market. The later 464 plus and 6128 plus,
intended to prolong the system's lifecycle with hardware updates,
were considerably less successful, as was the attempt to repackage
the plus hardware into a game console as the GX4000.

The CPC models' hardware is based on the Zilog Z80A CPU, complemented
with either 64 or 128 KB of RAM. Their computer-in-a-keyboard design
prominently features an integrated storage device, either a compact
cassette deck or 3-inch floppy disk drive. The main units were only
sold bundled with either a colour, green-screen or monochrome monitor
that doubles as the main unit's power supply.[2] Additionally, a wide
range of first and third-party hardware extensions such as external
disk drives, printers, and memory extensions, was available.

The CPC series was pitched against other home computers primarily used
to play video games and enjoyed a strong supply of game software. The
comparatively low price for a complete computer system with dedicated
monitor, its high-resolution monochrome text and graphic capabilities
and the possibility to run CP/M software also rendered the system
attractive for business users, which was reflected by a wide selection
of application software.
